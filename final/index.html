               On the Southeast Side of Chicago, baseball fields sit near piles of petcoke. Coal lines the bank of the Calumet river. The stench of sewage often makes its way indoors. 
               For decades, this predominantly Latine enclave has stored much of the city's toxic waste materials. Residents call their neighborhood the city's "sacrifice zone."

                The area is home to toxic industries pouring a million pounds of heavy metals into the air every year.  Since 2014, the state's Environmental Protection Agency has carried out special investigations of over 75 industries for non-compliance with pollution standards.

                The neighborhood used to be the hub of the steel industry. Mills and factories settled by the Calumet River and brought the neighborhood jobs and revenue. 
                When the steel industry came to a slow grinding halt in the 1980s, those mills shuttered. 
                
                Since then, the zoning rules have remained unchanged, allowing industries to make the Southeast Side their dumping ground.

                Most recently, metal scrapper company General Iron Industries sought to close their operations in Lincoln Park and relocate -- to the Southeast Side. Residents protested in response, some partaking in a 30-day hunger strike.
                <br> 
                In mid-March, the Chicago Department of Public Health asked the company for additional information before moving forward with a permit.

                Redlining not only kept residents of color out of certain neighborhoods, but also kept them from enjoying certain natural areas. For a long time, residents of the Southeast Side say they were not welcome in green spaces minutes away from their home. 
                Many are now calling on their neighbors to celebrate green spaces. Enjoying these spaces is activism too.

                In their call to the city needs to step up efforts to inspect and crack down on polluters, environmental justice activists hope they can escape the legacy of the steel industry. But for now, the toxic waste follows them -- on playgrounds, into their cars and homes.
